## Covering indexes

Covering indexes are an important optimization technique in MySQL. Although they are not a unique type of index, they are highly beneficial for improving query performance in specific cases. This guide will explain what covering indexes are, how they work, when to use them, and provide examples of queries with explanations.

### What are Covering Indexes?

A **covering index** is a regular index that contains all the data required to satisfy a query without needing to access the actual table. When a query uses a covering index, MySQL retrieves all the necessary data directly from the index, avoiding additional lookups to the table and improving performance.

#### Example

Imagine a table named `people` with columns `first_name`, `last_name`, `birthday`, and `state`. If you frequently query `first_name`, `last_name`, and `birthday`, you can create an index on those columns:

```sql
ALTER TABLE people ADD INDEX MULTI(first_name, last_name, birthday);
```

Now, if your query only selects `first_name`, `last_name`, and `birthday`, MySQL can satisfy the query entirely from the index, making it a **covering index**:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT first_name, last_name, birthday
FROM people
WHERE first_name = 'Neha' AND last_name = 'Adams'
LIMIT 10;
```

In this case, the query uses the index to retrieve the required data, eliminating the need to access the full table.

### How Do Covering Indexes Work?

To understand covering indexes, it's essential to understand how MySQL uses indexes:

1. **Primary Key (Clustered Index):**

   - The primary key in MySQL is a **clustered index**, which means that the table's rows are physically stored in the order of the primary key.

2. **Secondary Index:**
   - A secondary index stores copies of specific columns along with a pointer to the corresponding row in the table. When a query uses this secondary index, MySQL fetches data from the index and then follows the pointer to the actual table to retrieve any additional data.

When a query uses a covering index, all necessary data is already available in the index itself, so MySQL does not need to perform a second lookup to the actual table.

#### Example with `EXPLAIN`

The `EXPLAIN` statement provides insight into how MySQL executes a query and whether an index is used. Here’s an example:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT first_name, last_name, birthday
FROM people
WHERE first_name = 'Neha' AND last_name = 'Adams'
LIMIT 10;
```

In this query, MySQL uses the covering index `MULTI(first_name, last_name, birthday)` because all columns selected (`first_name`, `last_name`, and `birthday`) are part of the index. This eliminates the need to access the table.

However, if you modify the query to select an additional column, such as `state`, which is not part of the index:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT first_name, last_name, birthday, state
FROM people
WHERE first_name = 'Neha' AND last_name = 'Adams'
LIMIT 10;
```

Now, the index is not fully utilized as a covering index because MySQL needs to access the `state` column, which is not part of the index. As a result, MySQL must perform an additional lookup in the table to retrieve this column, and the index is no longer covering the entire query.

### When to Use Covering Indexes

Covering indexes can significantly improve query performance by avoiding table lookups. However, they are not suitable for every situation, and designing indexes efficiently requires a strategic approach.

#### Ideal Scenarios:

- **Simple queries**: Covering indexes work best for queries that involve only a few columns for filtering, selection, and sorting.
- **Performance-critical queries**: Use covering indexes for queries that are run frequently and have a significant performance impact.

#### Limitations:

- **Complex queries**: Queries that involve many columns or complex filtering might not benefit from covering indexes because including too many columns in an index can lead to large, inefficient indexes.
- **Index size**: Indexes take up storage space and can increase the size of the database. Using too many large indexes can lead to slower overall performance, particularly during write operations.

#### Best Practices:

- **Balance between index usage and performance**: It’s important to balance between creating indexes that optimize query performance and minimizing the number of indexes required. Too many indexes can degrade performance, especially on write-heavy databases.
- **Critical query optimization**: Focus on optimizing queries that are run frequently or are known bottlenecks, using covering indexes where it makes the most sense.

### Conclusion

Covering indexes are a powerful optimization technique in MySQL that can significantly improve query performance by retrieving all necessary data directly from the index without needing to access the actual table. However, they should be used selectively, keeping in mind that not all queries benefit from covering indexes, and over-indexing can lead to performance degradation.

Using tools like `EXPLAIN` can help you understand whether your indexes are being utilized effectively and guide your indexing strategy for optimal performance.
