## Primary key data types

#### What Data Type Should You Use for Primary Keys in MySQL?

Choosing the correct data type for the **primary key** is a critical part of designing a database schema. The primary key serves as a unique identifier for each record in a table, ensuring that every record can be uniquely and efficiently accessed. Itâ€™s essential to pick a data type that balances the database's needs with performance considerations.

#### Benefits of Using Unsigned Big Integers (`BIGINT UNSIGNED`)

A **best practice** in MySQL is to use an **unsigned big integer (`BIGINT UNSIGNED`)** as the data type for primary keys. Here are the benefits of using this approach:

- **Large Range**: Since it is unsigned, it provides more space (up to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615). This virtually eliminates the risk of running out of primary key

space, even in large databases with billions of records.

- **Auto-increment Support**: Unsigned big integers work well with the `AUTO_INCREMENT` feature, which ensures a natural order of record insertion, maintaining efficiency in indexing.

- **Performance**: Using an integer-based primary key like `BIGINT UNSIGNED` is more efficient for indexing and lookup operations, as integers are processed faster than other data types such as strings.

By choosing an unsigned big integer for your primary key, you reduce the risk of running out of unique identifiers and optimize performance.

#### Using Strings as Primary Keys

While integers are preferred, there are cases where developers may want to use **strings** as primary keys. This includes options like **UUIDs** or **GUIDs** (globally unique identifiers). However, there are some disadvantages to this approach:

- **Index Size**: Strings, especially UUIDs (128-bit) or GUIDs, are much larger than integers, leading to larger indexes and slower query performance.
- **B-tree Rebalancing**: Since string keys are less predictable than auto-incrementing integers, inserting new records can result in B-tree rebalancing, which degrades performance.

If strings must be used, consider **time-sorted GUIDs**, such as **ULIDs** (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifiers). ULIDs ensure that new records are added to the end of the table, minimizing the performance hit from rebalancing the B-tree structure.

#### Obfuscating the Primary Key

Some developers choose to use UUIDs or GUIDs for **obfuscation** purposes, particularly in APIs or URLs to hide the actual primary key. This, however, is not the best approach for database design.

- **Best Practice**: Use integers as primary keys for their performance benefits and create a **separate column** dedicated to obfuscation or public-facing identifiers. This keeps the database efficient while still achieving obfuscation goals.

#### Conclusion

When designing a database schema, the data type used for the primary key should be carefully considered. **Unsigned big integers (`BIGINT UNSIGNED`)** are typically the best choice due to their large capacity, support for auto-increment, and superior performance. While **strings** (e.g., UUIDs or GUIDs) are valid options in some cases, they come with significant trade-offs in terms of performance and index size. If strings are necessary, consider time-sorted variants like ULIDs to mitigate performance issues.

By choosing the right data type for primary keys, you can prevent future problems and ensure that your database is both scalable and efficient.
