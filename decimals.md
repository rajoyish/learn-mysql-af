### Storing Decimals in MySQL

When working on projects that require storing decimal values, choosing the correct data type is crucial to avoid inaccurate or imprecise data. This guide will walk you through the different options MySQL offers for storing decimal values and the best practices for each use case.

### The Four Types of Decimal Data Types

MySQL provides four main data types to store decimal or floating-point values:

1. **DECIMAL**: A fixed-precision data type that stores exact values. It is ideal for scenarios where precision is critical.
   
2. **NUMERIC**: An alias for DECIMAL in MySQL. Both are essentially the same.

3. **FLOAT**: A floating-point data type that stores approximate values. It is generally used for less precise values.

4. **DOUBLE**: A floating-point data type that stores larger and more precise values than FLOAT, but still stores approximations.

### When to Use DECIMAL

If you need **absolute precision**, such as for currency or financial data, the **DECIMAL** data type is your best option. With DECIMAL, you can define both the total number of digits and how many digits appear after the decimal point.

For example, to store up to 10 digits with 2 decimal places:

```sql
DECIMAL(10, 2)
```

- The `10` specifies the maximum number of digits.
- The `2` specifies how many digits are reserved for the decimal portion.

This allows precise control over how your values are stored, ensuring the accuracy of critical data, such as monetary amounts.

### When to Use FLOAT or DOUBLE

If absolute precision isn't required, you can use either **FLOAT** or **DOUBLE**. These data types are typically used for scientific or statistical calculations where small approximations are acceptable.

- **FLOAT**: Stores smaller, less precise values. 
- **DOUBLE**: Stores larger, more precise values compared to FLOAT, but still with approximate precision.

For example, if you're working with scientific data or measurements where slight inaccuracies are tolerable, FLOAT or DOUBLE is more appropriate.

### Example: Using DOUBLE

Let's create a table to explore how the **DOUBLE** data type behaves in practice.

#### Table Creation:

```sql
CREATE TABLE decimals (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  D1 DOUBLE,
  D2 DOUBLE
);
```

Here, we define a table with two columns, `D1` and `D2`, both of the type **DOUBLE**.

#### Inserting Data:

```sql
INSERT INTO decimals (D1, D2)
VALUES (100.4, 20.4), (-80.0, 0.0);
```

We insert two rows of data with decimal values in columns `D1` and `D2`.

#### Retrieving Data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM decimals;
```

Output:

| id  | D1    | D2   |
| --- | ----- | ---- |
| 1   | 100.4 | 20.4 |
| 2   | -80.0 | 0.0  |

#### Summing Values:

Let's sum the values of `D1` and `D2`:

```sql
SELECT SUM(D1), SUM(D2) FROM decimals;
```

Expected result:

| SUM(D1)          | SUM(D2) |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| 20.4000000000006 | 20.4    |

As seen, the results are close to what we expect but not exact due to the **approximate nature of DOUBLE**. This is a key point to remember when working with FLOAT or DOUBLEâ€”these data types can give slightly different results from what you might expect due to rounding and precision limitations.

If you want more precise calculations, you can drop the existing table by running `DROP TABLE decimals` and then execute the following code. The key difference here is using `DOUBLE(10,2)`, which allows for more precise values compared to the previous version.

```sql
CREATE TABLE decimals (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  D1 DOUBLE(10,2),
  D2 DOUBLE(10,2)
);

INSERT INTO decimals (D1, D2)
VALUES (100.4, 20.4), (-80.0, 0.0);

SELECT * FROM decimals;

SELECT SUM(D1), SUM(D2) FROM decimals;
```

In this version, `DOUBLE(10,2)` specifies that the values will be stored with a precision of up to 10 digits, with 2 digits after the decimal point, resulting in more accurate results.

### Conclusion

When working with decimal values in MySQL, it's important to choose the correct data type:

- Use **DECIMAL** (or NUMERIC) when you need **exact precision**, such as for financial data.
- Use **FLOAT** or **DOUBLE** when precision is less critical, such as for scientific calculations or measurements, but be aware that the values will be approximate.

Keep in mind that floating-point operations can introduce slight inaccuracies, so always assess your needs for precision carefully before selecting a data type.
