## 1.12 Schema Migrations

### The Importance of Migrations in Database Schema Management

As developers, it is common to face the need to change the database schema as business requirements evolve. Keeping track of these changes, and ensuring that the development team is aligned, can be challenging. This is where **migrations** become essential.

### What are Migrations?

At their core, migrations are a way to keep track of changes in the database schema over time. Essentially, migrations are a **folder full of SQL statements** that define how the database should evolve, making it easier to:

- Track changes to the schema.
- Version control the changes.
- Keep the team synchronized on schema updates.

Many full-stack frameworks, like Laravel, Rails, or Django, offer a built-in migrations feature. Regardless of the specific framework, the purpose of migrations remains the same:

> **Migrations allow developers to modify the database schema in a trackable, version-controlled, and maintainable way.**

### Why Migrations Matter

As the business evolves, new features or changes to existing features often require adjustments to the database structure. Without a structured way to manage these changes, development teams can fall out of sync. Migrations help address this by ensuring that:

1. **Changes are documented** in SQL format.
2. **Version control** systems (like Git) track these changes alongside code changes.
3. The **state of the database** is synchronized across different environments (local, staging, production).

### Best Practices for Migrations

When writing and managing migrations, it's important to adhere to best practices to avoid issues and ensure a smooth process. Here are some key practices to follow:

1. **Use Explicit SQL Statements**

   - Write clear and explicit SQL statements that demonstrate exactly how the database schema will change. This avoids ambiguity and ensures that anyone reviewing the migration understands its impact.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN age INT;
   ```

2. **Avoid Down Migrations**

   - **Down migrations** are intended to undo changes made in an **up migration**. However, they can cause problems if the undo action is incomplete or breaks dependencies. Many teams opt to avoid down migrations altogether to reduce risk.

3. **Utilize Version Control**

   - Migrations should be committed to version control (e.g., Git) so that changes are properly tracked. This also allows for better collaboration between team members, ensuring that everyone is working with the same schema.

4. **Be Strategic About When to Run Migrations**
   - Migrations can be resource-intensive, especially for large databases. Running migrations during off-peak hours or scheduled maintenance windows can reduce the impact on the application’s performance.
   - Use specialized tools like **pt-online-schema-change** or **gh-ost** (GitHub Online Schema Change) to apply changes with minimal downtime.

### Running Migrations Without Downtime

On managed platforms like **PlanetScale**, developers have the option to use branching and merging processes to run migrations without downtime. This approach involves creating a branch for schema changes, applying migrations there, and then merging the branch back into the main database environment, ensuring smooth transitions without interrupting live systems.

### Conclusion

Migrations are a critical tool for managing database schema changes in a trackable and maintainable way. By following best practices—such as writing explicit SQL, avoiding down migrations, and using version control—developers can successfully manage the evolution of the database schema as business needs change.

By understanding and carefully planning when and how to run migrations, teams can minimize downtime and ensure smooth operations as the application grows and changes.
